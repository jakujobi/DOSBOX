Assembly Program: Character Movement Across Screen

1. Start

2. Setup:
   - Define data segment for storing character and number of trips
   - Define stack segment for subroutine calls

3. Main Procedure:
   - Initialize data segment
   - Initialize stack segment
   - Call InputCharacter procedure
   - Call InputNumberOfTrips procedure
   - Call MoveCharacter procedure
   - Terminate program

4. InputCharacter Procedure:
   - Display prompt for character input
   - Read character from user
   - Store character in a specific memory location

5. InputNumberOfTrips Procedure:
   - Initialize validInput flag to false
   - While validInput is false:
     - Display prompt for number of trips
     - Read number from user
     - Check if number is between 1 and 3
     - If valid, set validInput to true, else display error message

6. MoveCharacter Procedure:
   - For each trip (from 1 to numberOfTrips):
     - Move character from left to right across the screen
     - Then move character from right to left back to the start

7. CharacterMovement Subprocedure:
   - Use loop to move character across the screen
   - Use BIOS interrupt or direct video memory access for display
   - Call Delay procedure between each movement

8. Delay Procedure:
   - Implement a delay loop to slow down character movement

9. End
